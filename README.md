# Intro and Course Overview.

- We wil be covering following:

<img src="courseOverview.PNG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

# What is docker.

<img src="whatIsDocker.PNG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- **Container** is packed all the different parts inside. 

# What problems Docker solves in development and deployment process.

- Before **Docker**, all developers needed to install their own setups of tools for their specific needs.
    - Os specific.
    - Configuration specific.
    - Etc.

<img src="developementProcess.PNG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

<img src="beforeDocker.PNG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

1. Setting up environment individually different to different os.

<img src="dockerDevelopementProcess.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

1. All these dependencies are inside container. 
2. As **developer,** you just need to execute **one docker command** and get **docker container package** `docker run postgres`.

- Docker **standardizes** process of running any service on any local dev environment.
    - **More** time for development than setting up configuration.
    - With docker you can have same service running on local device whiteout any conflict. 

<img src="dockerDevelopementProcess.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

<img src="deploymentProcessWithConainers.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- With containers â†’ DevOps team just needs to fetch and run **Docker artifact**.

<img src="differentVersions.PNG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

1. Different versions of same application. **This is very** difficult without **docker**.

<img src="devOpsInstallingInOldWay.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. Old way was, develop and ship it to the devOps team, which made configuration and installation. This was very error prone.

<img src="deploymentsBeforeContainers.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

<img src="deploymentsAfterContainers.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

- There will be **Docker Artifact** which handles.

<img src="processWithContainer.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

# Virtual Machine vs Docker.

- Big questions below.

<img src="vmVsVirtulization.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

<img src="howKernerIsCommincating.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. OS will be installing on the system and it will communicate between **different** layers.

2. **Software** will be on top of application layer. This will be communicating with the **OS layer**. 

<img src="bigQuestion.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

- So the **big question** these both **docker** and **vm** are virtualization tools, so which layer these both **virtualize**.

<img src="virtualizesBoth.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

- Docker virtualize **OS Application Layer**.
- Virtual machine virtualizes.
**OS Application Layer** and **OS kernel** â†’ Meaning virtualizes **complete operating system**.

<img src="whatIsDifference.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

- What it means:
    - Docker image is, a couple of **MB**.
    - Dockers container takes **seconds** to start.
    - Dockers compatible only with **Linux distros**.
    - Vm images, a couple of **GB**.
    - Vm takes **minutes** to start.
    - Vm is running with all **OS**.

<img src="runningDockerProblem.JPG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. Docker can't run Linux based docker image in **Windows Host**.

- Docker Desktop.
    - Linux containers run on Windows or macOS.
    - This is solved with **Hypervisor layer** with small Linux distro.
    `install Docker Desktop`.

#  Install Docker.

- Installing latest from docker website.

<img src="installingDocker.PNG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

# Docker Images vs Containers.

- This image is like **.zip** and **.jar** file.

<img src="dockerContainirizationsAndImages.PNG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- **Docker images** are like **.jar** a file packaged in containers.
    - It has compiled code.
    - It also has **complete environment configuration**.
        - Application, any services(Js app)(node, npm) needed, Os Layer(Linux).
    - Add env variables, create directories.

- **Docker Container** is running image.
- You can one you can run multiple container.

<img src="imagesAndContiners.JPG" alt="alt text" width="200"/>

1. Images can be run in containers

- `docker images` Show what images we have locally

- `docker ps` List running containers

# Docker Registries.

- There are images stored in Docker Register

- Official images are available from applications like Redis, Mongo, Postgres etc.
    - There can be verified "Official" images or unofficial ones.

- One the biggest docker register store is **DockerHub**
    - One of Reddis [Images](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) 

<img src="dockerOfficialImages.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

 # Docker Image Versions.

<img src="imageVersioning.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- If you need specific version, you can choose specific docker image which has right **tag**
    - `latest` is the latest which was build

# Pull and Run Docker containers.

- To download image `docker pull nginx:1.23`

<img src="dockerPull.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- To list images `docker images`

- Running images into container `docker run nginx:1.23`
    - With `-d` stop blocking

- Docker generates random name automatically

<img src="dockerRun.JPG" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

# Port Binding.

<img src="portBinding.JPG" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

- We need to **expose** container **ports**
    - This is done with **Port Binding** 

<img src="runningInport.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- You can see what ports containers are running in

<img src="exposingImageToLocalHostPorts.JPG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

1. Port inside container
2. Exposing port to local host

- We can expose ports to localhost when creating container with special **flag**

<img src="dockerStop.JPG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

<br>

<img src="dockerpublish.JPG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

- We can publish ports when creating image with **flag** 

`docker run -d -p 9000:80 nginx:1.23`

<img src="dockerpublish.JPG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

- With following port structure

<img src="portStructure.JPG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

<br>

<img src="afterRunningContainerWithHostInformation.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

1. After running with opening with following ports
    - We can see what is being mapped on 

<br>

- Now we can see its deployed into port 9000

<img src="deployedInto9000.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- To expose logs from docker 
    - `docker logs 6cb988ce6e05`, where last one is docker id

- It's standard to bind same port into container and which is exposed outside of container

# Start and Stop containers.

- Docker run always creates new container

- To see all container which docker have created. You can use 

`docker ps -a`
- To start container you can use `docker start {container} = start one or more stopped containers`. Example `docker logs 6cb988ce6e05`

# Private Docker Registries.

- When companies, creates their own public private docker registries.

# Registry vs Repository.

<br>

<img src="registeryVsRepository.JPG" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

# Dockerfile.

- We want to build our docker image, when our application version is finished
    - We do this by writing "definition" how to build image
        - This is called **docker file**

<img src="dockerBaseImage.JPG" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

- Telling to build base image **FROM** base image

<br>

<img src="from.JPG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

- In docker file you can run Linux commands!
    - This is done with **RUN** directive

- **COPY** copies files from src and adds them to containers path

- **WORKDIR /app** changes working directly inside docker

- Last command in docker file is **CMD**

<img src="cmd.JPG" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

# Example of docker file.

```

FROM node:19-alpine

COPY package.json /app/
COPY src /app/

# COPY src /app/, last / is important. Docker will create new folder if there is no 

WORKDIR /app

RUN npm install

CMD ["node", "server.js"]

```

# Build Image.

<img src="dockerBuild.JPG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

<br>

<img src="tag.JPG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>


- Building image `docker build -t node-app:1.0 .`
    - Last one is location of Dockerfile

<img src="creatingImage.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- You can see image is created in layers

- We can run our newly created image `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 node-app:1.0`

- We can see that our application inside docker is running and its being exposed to `localhost:3000`

<img src="runningIn3000Verify.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

# Docker UI Client.

- Same tool is found in UI.

<img src="dockerUI.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

# Docker in complete software development lifecycle.

- CI server can create docker image automatically 

<img src="dockerBuildSycle.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

1. After commit, **CI server** can be configured with to push and create docker image into **Private Repository**

# Additional about docker.

- We can connect docker app and MySQL with help of **network**

<img src="dockerNetworks.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

1. When running docker container they are running in isolated networks

- Listing all network `docker network ls`.

- Creating docker network `docker network create spring-net`.

- Connecting our **container** with given **network** `docker network connect spring-net mysqldb`.

- Inspecting our container for attached networks `docker container inspect mysqldb`.

- We can attach container to **certain network** when starting the container.

```
docker run -p 9090:8080 --name app --net spring-net -e MYSQL_HOST=mysqldb -e MYSQL_USER=root -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_PORT=3306 app
```

# Creating MySQL running in localhost container.

- Starting and pulling and starting MySQL image `docker run -d -p 3307:3306 --name mysqldb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=user_rest_demo mysql`.

- To test connection `localhost:3007` and configure `allowPublicKeyRetrieval` to **true**.

# Docker Volume.

<img src="dockerVolume.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- When restarting application data is lost, we can use **volumes** to keep data saved.

# Intro and Course Overview.

 - We will cover:
    - **What** is Docker compose
    - **What problems** it solves?
    - Common **Use cases**
    - Hands-on **demos**
    - **Limitations** of Docker compose

# Pre-Requisites to learn Docker Compose.

- It's necessarily to know Docker containers before this one, if no [Watch](#docker-crash-course-in-1h)
    - It's advised to learn **YAML** format, if no [Check](#)

<img src="pre-requisitve.jpg" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

# What is Docker Compose.

<img src="appInPieces.jpg" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

1. Application can be broken into smaller pieces.
    - Or **Microservice** application.

<img src="whatIsDockerCompose.jpg" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

- All of these software components must be containerized and deployed/run together.
    - These services need to communicate together.

1. We need some tool to control these actions:
    - Define and run multiple Services in 1 environment.
- Each container is having own configuration and for this we can use **Docker Compose**, which makes our life easier.  

# Demo - Without Docker Compose.

- Demo will have 2 Docker containers.    
    - Just with **Docker** commands.

1. Create Docker Network.
2. Start MongoDB Container.
3. Start Mongo Express Container(UI for MongoDB).

```
//Create mongo-network first
docker network create
 mongo-network
```

<img src="dockerNetworkCommand.jpg" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

1. We can see network is being created.

```

//List all networks
docker network ls

```

- Running MongoDB in Docker.
    - You can see default ports from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) and default usernames and passwords.

- For **mongoDB**.

```
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=supersecret --network mongo-network --name mongodb mongo
```

- For **mongo-express**.
    - Its just font-end for **mongoDB**.

```
docker run -d -p 8081:8081 -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=supersecret -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb --network mongo-network --name mongo-express mongo-express
```

- To try if these work go to `http://localhost:8081/` and log in
    - **mongoDB** depends on **mongo-express** and to communicate each other **isolated virtual network** must be configured and working!

# Why Docker Compose.

<img src="lotOfContainers.jpg" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

1. Problem comes when a lot of containers are needed to start and configure to communicate 

- We have one way to manage these â†’ **Docker Compose**.  
    - This is based on **YAML File**

<img src="yaml.jpg" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

# From Docker Commands To Compose File.

- **Docker-Compose** abstract all the **CMD** commands into **docker-compose** file.

<img src="mappingToCompose.jpg" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

<br>

<img src="compose.yaml.jpg" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

1. **Required** attributes for docker file!
    - First line, **version** of docker-compose which **needs** to be compatible with Compose is **installed locally**
2. **Services**. List all services, you want to run

<img src="mappingFromDockerCommandToCompose.yaml.jpg" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

1. YAML transfers this cmd commands to **.YAML** one configurable file 
    - Here you can see one service **being configured**.
2. Name of service being configured.

<img src="mongoDbConfiguration.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

1. **Container name**, this will map form command to

2. From which **image name** docker container will be built from. You can specify version list

3. **List of ports** which will be mapping to container.
    - Most time this
    you have only one **mapping**
        - `3.1` **Host** port and `3.2` port inside **Container** 
4. List of Environment variables for docker 


<img src="anotherSeriviceConfigured.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- As you can see another service is below other one!

<br>

<img src="sampleOfYaml.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- This how the **YAML** will look like for previous example configuration.

- ***Docker Compose** can help your team to collaborate more efficiently since, now they can see how these services can be run separately. **Not** just random cmd commands.

<img src="networkConfigurationNotIncludedWithComposeFile.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

1. You don't have to include network to **YAML** configuration. This will be taken care by default in docker compose 
    - Docker takes care of creating **docker network**
        - From services from list

<img src="yamlIndentation.JPG" alt="yaml" width="500"/>

1. When making **YAML** file be careful of indentation

- Running **YAML**

# Docker Compose Commands 

- We are trying to execute **compose** file
    - First we remove our old **networks** and **containers**


```
docker rm hashGoesHere // Removing container

docker network rm mongo-network // Removing docker network
```

- If you have **docker** installed in your computer, you don't need to install **Docker Compose**

- starting with docker compose
    - `docker-build -f mongo-services.yaml up`
        - `up` argument for running from up to down different services

<img src="runningDockerCompose.JPG" alt="alt text" width="550"/>

<br>

<img src="executingDockerCompose.JPG" alt="alt text" width="550"/>

1. You can see how **network names** are created. **1.** prefix from folder where **.YAML** was run. 

> Docker basically takes folder where it was executed and prefixes with names.

- Docker logs are mixed since two containers were started at sane time.

# Control Startup Order

- When multiple services
    - When we need db before front-end

- This decency can be done using `depends_on`
    - This affects control of the services
    - This will start container **only** when dependencies are finished

<img src="mongoDepends.PNG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

- Example using `depends_on:` in case of **mongo-express:**


```
  mongo-express:
    image: mongo-express
    ports:
     - 8081:8081
    environment:
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=: admin
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=: supersecret
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=: mongodb
    depends_on:
      - "mongodb" # Takes list of services
```

- Whole `mongo-express` service **won't be** started, before `mongodb` is up and running


- Running following **Compose** in detach mode `docker-compose -f mongo-services.yaml up -d`


# Docker Compose Commands (Up and Down vs Start and Stop)

- We could stop containers using `docker stop`, but with big compose files this get problematic

<img src="dockerDown.PNG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

1. We can close all containers in the same time and remove them with following command `docker-compose -f mongo-services.yaml down`
    - This will clean **networks**, **containers** and **docker images**

<img src="reminderAboutContainers.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. Data will be gone once container is removed
2. Unless you define **volumes**

<img src="useCases.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1.  Data will be lost when container is removed
2.  Data will be saved

- These have different **use cases** 

# Connect own web application

- Here we will add own app to our services

# Variables in Docker Compose

- todo

# Docker Compose Secrets

- todo

# Use image from private repository

- todo 


# Limitations, Docker Compose vs Kubernetes
