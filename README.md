# Intro and Course Overview.

- We wil be covering following:

<img src="courseOverview.PNG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

# What is docker.

<img src="whatIsDocker.PNG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- **Container** is packed all the different parts inside. 

# What problems Docker solves in development and deployment process.

- Before **Docker**, all developers needed to install their own setups of tools for their specific needs.
    - Os specific.
    - Configuration specific.
    - Etc.

<img src="developementProcess.PNG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

<img src="beforeDocker.PNG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

1. Setting up environment individually different to different os.

<img src="dockerDevelopementProcess.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

1. All these dependencies are inside container. 
2. As **developer,** you just need to execute **one docker command** and get **docker container package** `docker run postgres`.

- Docker **standardizes** process of running any service on any local dev environment.
    - **More** time for development than setting up configuration.
    - With docker you can have same service running on local device whiteout any conflict. 

<img src="dockerDevelopementProcess.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

<img src="deploymentProcessWithConainers.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- With containers â†’ DevOps team just needs to fetch and run **Docker artifact**.

<img src="differentVersions.PNG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

1. Different versions of same application. **This is very** difficult without **docker**.

<img src="devOpsInstallingInOldWay.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. Old way was, develop and ship it to the devOps team, which made configuration and installation. This was very error prone.

<img src="deploymentsBeforeContainers.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

<img src="deploymentsAfterContainers.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

- There will be **Docker Artifact** which handles.

<img src="processWithContainer.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

# Virtual Machine vs Docker.

- Big questions below.

<img src="vmVsVirtulization.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

<img src="howKernerIsCommincating.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. OS will be installing on the system and it will communicate between **different** layers.

2. **Software** will be on top of application layer. This will be communicating with the **OS layer**. 

<img src="bigQuestion.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

- So the **big question** these both **docker** and **vm** are virtualization tools, so which layer these both **virtualize**.

<img src="virtualizesBoth.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

- Docker virtualize **OS Application Layer**.
- Virtual machine virtualizes.
**OS Application Layer** and **OS kernel** â†’ Meaning virtualizes **complete operating system**.

<img src="whatIsDifference.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

- What it means:
    - Docker image is, a couple of **MB**.
    - Dockers container takes **seconds** to start.
    - Dockers compatible only with **Linux distros**.
    - Vm images, a couple of **GB**.
    - Vm takes **minutes** to start.
    - Vm is running with all **OS**.

<img src="runningDockerProblem.JPG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. Docker can't run Linux based docker image in **Windows Host**.

- Docker Desktop.
    - Linux containers run on Windows or macOS.
    - This is solved with **Hypervisor layer** with small Linux distro.
    `install Docker Desktop`.

#  Install Docker.

- Installing latest from docker website.

<img src="installingDocker.PNG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

# Docker Images vs Containers.

- This image is like **.zip** and **.jar** file.

<img src="dockerContainirizationsAndImages.PNG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- **Docker images** are like **.jar** a file packaged in containers.
    - It has compiled code.
    - It also has **complete environment configuration**.
        - Application, any services(Js app)(node, npm) needed, Os Layer(Linux).
    - Add env variables, create directories.

- **Docker Container** is running image.
- You can one you can run multiple container.

<img src="imagesAndContiners.JPG" alt="alt text" width="200"/>

1. Images can be run in containers

- `docker images` Show what images we have locally

- `docker ps` List running containers

# Docker Registries.

- There are images stored in Docker Register

- Official images are available from applications like Redis, Mongo, Postgres etc.
    - There can be verified "Official" images or unofficial ones.

- One the biggest docker register store is **DockerHub**
    - One of Reddis [Images](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) 

<img src="dockerOfficialImages.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

 # Docker Image Versions.

<img src="imageVersioning.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- If you need specific version, you can choose specific docker image which has right **tag**
    - `latest` is the latest which was build

# Pull and Run Docker containers.

- To download image `docker pull nginx:1.23`

<img src="dockerPull.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- To list images `docker images`

- Running images into container `docker run nginx:1.23`
    - With `-d` stop blocking

- Docker generates random name automatically

<img src="dockerRun.JPG" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

# Port Binding.

<img src="portBinding.JPG" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

- We need to **expose** container **ports**
    - This is done with **Port Binding** 

<img src="runningInport.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- You can see what ports containers are running in

<img src="exposingImageToLocalHostPorts.JPG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

1. Port inside container
2. Exposing port to local host

- We can expose ports to localhost when creating container with special **flag**

<img src="dockerStop.JPG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

<br>

<img src="dockerpublish.JPG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

- We can publish ports when creating image with **flag** 

`docker run -d -p 9000:80 nginx:1.23`

<img src="dockerpublish.JPG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

- With following port structure

<img src="portStructure.JPG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

<br>

<img src="afterRunningContainerWithHostInformation.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

1. After running with opening with following ports
    - We can see what is being mapped on 

<br>

- Now we can see its deployed into port 9000

<img src="deployedInto9000.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- To expose logs from docker 
    - `docker logs 6cb988ce6e05`, where last one is docker id

- It's standard to bind same port into container and which is exposed outside of container

# Start and Stop containers.

- Docker run always creates new container

- To see all container which docker have created. You can use 

`docker ps -a`
- To start container you can use `docker start {container} = start one or more stopped containers`. Example `docker logs 6cb988ce6e05`

# Private Docker Registries.

- When companies, creates their own public private docker registries.

# Registry vs Repository.

<br>

<img src="registeryVsRepository.JPG" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

# Dockerfile.

- We want to build our docker image, when our application version is finished
    - We do this by writing "definition" how to build image
        - This is called **docker file**

<img src="dockerBaseImage.JPG" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

- Telling to build base image **FROM** base image

<br>

<img src="from.JPG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

- In docker file you can run Linux commands!
    - This is done with **RUN** directive

- **COPY** copies files from src and adds them to containers path

- **WORKDIR /app** changes working directly inside docker

- Last command in docker file is **CMD**

<img src="cmd.JPG" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

# Example of docker file.

```

FROM node:19-alpine

COPY package.json /app/
COPY src /app/

# COPY src /app/, last / is important. Docker will create new folder if there is no 

WORKDIR /app

RUN npm install

CMD ["node", "server.js"]

```

# Build Image.

<img src="dockerBuild.JPG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

<br>

<img src="tag.JPG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>


- Building image `docker build -t node-app:1.0 .`
    - Last one is location of Dockerfile

<img src="creatingImage.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- You can see image is created in layers

- We can run our newly created image `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 node-app:1.0`

- We can see that our application inside docker is running and its being exposed to `localhost:3000`

<img src="runningIn3000Verify.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

# Docker UI Client.

- Same tool is found in UI.

<img src="dockerUI.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

# Docker in complete software development lifecycle.

- CI server can create docker image automatically 

<img src="dockerBuildSycle.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

1. After commit, **CI server** can be configured with to push and create docker image into **Private Repository**

# Additional about docker.

- We can connect docker app and MySQL with help of **network**

<img src="dockerNetworks.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

1. When running docker container they are running in isolated networks

- Listing all network `docker network ls`.

- Creating docker network `docker network create spring-net`.

- Connecting our **container** with given **network** `docker network connect spring-net mysqldb`.

- Inspecting our container for attached networks `docker container inspect mysqldb`.

- We can attach container to **certain network** when starting the container.

```
docker run -p 9090:8080 --name app --net spring-net -e MYSQL_HOST=mysqldb -e MYSQL_USER=root -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_PORT=3306 app
```

# Creating MySQL running in localhost container.

- Starting and pulling and starting MySQL image `docker run -d -p 3307:3306 --name mysqldb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=user_rest_demo mysql`.

- To test connection `localhost:3007` and configure `allowPublicKeyRetrieval` to **true**.

# Docker Volume.

<img src="dockerVolume.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- When restarting application data is lost, we can use **volumes** to keep data saved.

# Intro and Course Overview.

 - We will cover:
    - **What** is Docker compose
    - **What problems** it solves?
    - Common **Use cases**
    - Hands-on **demos**
    - **Limitations** of Docker compose

# Pre-Requisites to learn Docker Compose.

- It's necessarily to know Docker containers before this one, if no [Watch](#docker-crash-course-in-1h)
    - It's advised to learn **YAML** format, if no [Check](#)

<img src="pre-requisitve.jpg" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

# What is Docker Compose.

<img src="appInPieces.jpg" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

1. Application can be broken into smaller pieces.
    - Or **Microservice** application.

<img src="whatIsDockerCompose.jpg" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

- All of these software components must be containerized and deployed/run together.
    - These services need to communicate together.

1. We need some tool to control these actions:
    - Define and run multiple Services in 1 environment.
- Each container is having own configuration and for this we can use **Docker Compose**, which makes our life easier.  

# Demo - Without Docker Compose.

- Demo will have 2 Docker containers.    
    - Just with **Docker** commands.

1. Create Docker Network.
2. Start MongoDB Container.
3. Start Mongo Express Container(UI for MongoDB).

```
//Create mongo-network first
docker network create
 mongo-network
```

<img src="dockerNetworkCommand.jpg" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

1. We can see network is being created.

```

//List all networks
docker network ls

```

- Running MongoDB in Docker.
    - You can see default ports from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) and default usernames and passwords.

- For **mongoDB**.

```
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=supersecret --network mongo-network --name mongodb mongo
```

- For **mongo-express**.
    - Its just font-end for **mongoDB**.

```
docker run -d -p 8081:8081 -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=supersecret -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb --network mongo-network --name mongo-express mongo-express
```

- To try if these work go to `http://localhost:8081/` and log in
    - **mongoDB** depends on **mongo-express** and to communicate each other **isolated virtual network** must be configured and working!

# Why Docker Compose.

<img src="lotOfContainers.jpg" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

1. Problem comes when a lot of containers are needed to start and configure to communicate 

- We have one way to manage these â†’ **Docker Compose**.  
    - This is based on **YAML File**

<img src="yaml.jpg" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

# From Docker Commands To Compose File.

- **Docker-Compose** abstract all the **CMD** commands into **docker-compose** file.

<img src="mappingToCompose.jpg" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

<br>

<img src="compose.yaml.jpg" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

1. **Required** attributes for docker file!
    - First line, **version** of docker-compose which **needs** to be compatible with Compose is **installed locally**
2. **Services**. List all services, you want to run

<img src="mappingFromDockerCommandToCompose.yaml.jpg" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

1. YAML transfers this cmd commands to **.YAML** one configurable file 
    - Here you can see one service **being configured**.
2. Name of service being configured.

<img src="mongoDbConfiguration.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

1. **Container name**, this will map form command to

2. From which **image name** docker container will be built from. You can specify version list

3. **List of ports** which will be mapping to container.
    - Most time this
    you have only one **mapping**
        - `3.1` **Host** port and `3.2` port inside **Container** 
4. List of Environment variables for docker 


<img src="anotherSeriviceConfigured.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- As you can see another service is below other one!

<br>

<img src="sampleOfYaml.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- This how the **YAML** will look like for previous example configuration.

- ***Docker Compose** can help your team to collaborate more efficiently since, now they can see how these services can be run separately. **Not** just random cmd commands.

<img src="networkConfigurationNotIncludedWithComposeFile.JPG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

1. You don't have to include network to **YAML** configuration. This will be taken care by default in docker compose 
    - Docker takes care of creating **docker network**
        - From services from list

<img src="yamlIndentation.JPG" alt="yaml" width="500"/>

1. When making **YAML** file be careful of indentation

- Running **YAML**

# Docker Compose Commands 

- We are trying to execute **compose** file
    - First we remove our old **networks** and **containers**


```
docker rm hashGoesHere // Removing container

docker network rm mongo-network // Removing docker network
```

- If you have **docker** installed in your computer, you don't need to install **Docker Compose**

- starting with docker compose
    - `docker-build -f mongo-services.yaml up`
        - `up` argument for running from up to down different services

<img src="runningDockerCompose.JPG" alt="alt text" width="550"/>

<br>

<img src="executingDockerCompose.JPG" alt="alt text" width="550"/>

1. You can see how **network names** are created. **1.** prefix from folder where **.YAML** was run. 

> Docker basically takes folder where it was executed and prefixes with names.

- Docker logs are mixed since two containers were started at sane time.

# Control Startup Order

- When multiple services.
    - When we need db before front-end

- This decency can be done using `depends_on`
    - This affects control of the services
    - This will start container **only** when dependencies are finished

<img src="mongoDepends.PNG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

- Example using `depends_on:` in case of **mongo-express:**


```
  mongo-express:
    image: mongo-express
    ports:
     - 8081:8081
    environment:
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=: admin
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=: supersecret
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=: mongodb
    depends_on:
      - "mongodb" # Takes list of services
```

- Whole `mongo-express` service **won't be** started, before `mongodb` is up and running


- Running following **Compose** in detach mode `docker-compose -f mongo-services.yaml up -d`


# Docker Compose Commands (Up and Down vs Start and Stop)

- We could stop containers using `docker stop`, but with big compose files this get problematic

<img src="dockerDown.PNG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

1. We can close all containers in the same time and remove them with following command `docker-compose -f mongo-services.yaml down`
    - This will clean **networks**, **containers** and **docker images**

<img src="reminderAboutContainers.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. Data will be gone once container is removed
2. Unless you define **volumes**

<img src="useCases.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1.  Data will be lost when container is removed.
2.  Data will be saved.

- These have different **use cases**.

# Connect own web application.

- Here we will add own app to our services

# Variables in Docker Compose.

- todo

# Docker Compose Secrets.

- todo

# Use image from private repository.

- todo 


# Limitations, Docker Compose vs Kubernetes.

# Intro and Course Overview.

1. Introduction.
2. Main components
3. Setup.
4. Demo project.

# What is Kubernetes.

<img src="kubernetes.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. There can be hundreds or thousands of containers.

- What problems does **Kubernetes** solve?
- What are the tasks of the **orchestration** tool?

<img src="needForOrhestration.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

- What features orchestration tool offer?

<img src="offering.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. User can access is it fast!
2. More load when more load.
3. Backing up data, if something goes wrong.

# Kubernetes Architecture.

<img src="kubernetesArchitecture.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. At least one **master** node.
2. **Worker Node** referred as `Nodes`
    - These having `kubelet` process running on it.
        - This is part of **Kubernetes**, so these nodes can communicate with each other. 
3. Each work node has docker containers deployed on it!
4. So **what** is running on master node? There is multiple **kubernetes** processes running here to manage the **cluster**.

<img src="runningOnMasterServer.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. API Server, gateway to the **K8** cluster. 
    - **1.2** This gateway can be accessed thought **UI**, **API** or **CLI**. 
2. Keep overview what happening in **cluster**.
3. Scheduling work and loads on node. 
4. **etcd** has status data of nodes and configurations. Back up process is made form these **etcd** configurations.

<img src="oneBigNetwork.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. Nodes are talking together with help of this **Virtual Network**.
    - Network turns nodes into one this **big powerful machine**.

<img src="oneBigNetwork.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. Most load will be on **Worker Nodes**, so these are most of time bigger. 
2. **Master Node** is much more important, once you lose **Master Node**, you will lose access to the kubernetes cluster.
3. So you will have multiple masters for backup.

<img src="mainComponents.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. Main components of **Kubernetes**. 

# Node and Pod.

<img src="pod.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

- **Node** is virtual or physical machine.

1. **Pod** is smallest unit of **Kubernetes**.
    - **Pod** is **abstraction** over container.

<img src="pod1.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. **Pod** is usually ment to run one container at the time.
    - It is possible to run multiple container inside one **pod**. 
2. **Kubernetes** has its own network, each **pot** get own IP address. Internal IP address.  
3. **Pods** are **ephemeral!**
    - **pods** can die easily.
3. **Pod** will die to some here, and new one will get its place. 

- This **new** **pod** is having **new IP address**.
    - So, every time IP address are need to configure again!

- This is where concept **Service** comes in!

# Service & Ingress.

<img src="svc.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. **Service** can attach to **pod**, it will have own IP address.
2. If **pod** dies, IP address of **pod** will stay! No need to change endpoint.

<img src="externalService.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. **App** should be accessible from external sources. We we need open **External Service**.
2. **db** should not be accessible from outside. **Internal Service**.

<img src="ingress.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

- **Ingress**, will provide **HTTPS** and URL name for **External Service**.

# ConfigMap & Secret.   

<img src="rebuildingTheApplication.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. If the endpoint or service name will change, all of these needs to be ran. 

<img src="cmExternal.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. Kubernetes has **ConfigMap**, it will save all the URL data. 
2. You just point to this **ConfigMap** for URL.

- Saving all the non-confidential data in **ConfigMap** is risky, that why there is **Secret**.

<img src="secret.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. Passwords and user names can be also configured.
2. There is service called **Secret** which saves passwords and user in safe way. **Kubernetes** does **not** save these in save format. **Kubernetes** advices to use **3rd** party tools to encrypt the passwords.
3. We just need to connect this one to the **pod**.
4. **PRO TIP**. We can use secret references in properties file or in env variable.

-  This **Secret** can have passwords, certificates and other things which needs to be encrypted.

# Volume.

- Whiteout **Volumes** data would be lost from db when restarted.

<img src="volume.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. Attaches hard drive to your **pod** or **remote** storage.

- Now when database pod is restarted, all the data is persisted.

<img src="kubernetesData.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. Its admins job to handle kubernetes data into right place.

# Deployment & StatefulSet.

- We are replicating on **pod** in multiple servers.
    - In case if **pod** dies.

<img src="loadBalancer.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. Node being replicated and connected trough **service**.

- Service having, **permanent IP** and **load balancer**.

<img src="bluePrint.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

- For replicating pod we would.

1. Define **blueprint** for Pods and use this **blueprint** for creating much of replicas as needed.

- This is called **deploy** in Kubernetes components.

<img src="deploy.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

- You will not be creating **pods**, you will be creating **deployments**.
    - In **deployments** you can scale down or up.

<img src="podDies.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. When **pod** dies, other one will take its place.

<img src="dbDeployments.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. We can't **replicate** via Deployment!

<img src="dbShared.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. We need to control who access data inside db.
    - Mechanics needed which **pod**  is reading or writing to the specific database . 

<img src="statefullness.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

- **statefulset** kubernetes components.

<img src="deploymentAndStatefull.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

1. **StatefulSet** should be used when want to use of stateful features. 

- **StatefulSet** in usage of kubernetes cluster can be **difficult**.

- DB are often hosted **outside** of Kubernetes cluster.

## Summary, popular Kubernetes components.

<img src="main1.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

<img src="main2.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

<img src="main3.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

<img src="main4.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

- These **core** components, we can build kubernetes clusters.

# Kubernetes Configuration.

<img src="kubernetesConfiguration.PNG" alt="alt text" width="700"/>

1. All nodes which **Kubernetes**  has goes trough **API SERVER**. 
    - All of these requests can be made trough **UI**, **API** and **CLI**.

2. Configuration for creating component called `deployment`.

- Kubernetes **configuration** has **three** parts.

<img src="metaDataInConfigurationdata.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700"/>

- **First part** is **metadata** of component.

<img src="spesifications.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700"/>

- **Second part** is **specifications**. We put here configuration what we wan't to apply to that component.

<img src="kindOfdeployment.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700"/>

- **spec** are **specific** to the **kind**  of configuration.

- The **Third part** is a **status**.

<img src="status.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700"/>

- **Status** is automatically generated and added by **Kubernetes**.

<img src="selfRecovery.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700"/>

- When **Kubernetes** notices difference between **Desired** and **Actual** state. **Kubernetes** tries to fix this using its **self-recovery** features.
    - Example here, we want **two** replicas of `nginx` deployment. 

<img src="k8.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700"/>

1. **Kubernetes** will add here status of deployment and updates it constantly.

<img src="replica.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700"/>

1. If only **one** replica is detected to be running by **comparing** the specification.

2. Another replica needs to be created **ASAP** .

<img src="statusData.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700"/>

1.  Where does **K8** gets this status data?

<img src="etcd.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700"/>

1. **ETCD** holds any **data** of k8 component! So, it also holds **status** data.

<img src="yamlConfigurationFIles.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700"/>

- These configurations files are usually stored **with you code**.
    - Or **own** git repository.

# Minikube and Kubectl - Setup K8s cluster locally.

<img src="minicupes.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700"/>

1. In production there is usually multiple **Masters**.
2. There is also multiple **Worker Nodes**.
3. These have all have separate responsibilities. **Master** and **Node**. So there will be separate virtual or physical machines, which each represent node.

- Setting up **cluster** like this will be difficult, since it needs lot of **resources**. 
    - CPU, Memory etc...

<img src="minicupe.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700"/>

- **Minikube** tool which has  one node cluster. Which has **master processes** and **Worker processes** running inside **one** machine.

- It has docker pre-installed.

<img src="whatIsKubeCtl.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

1. **Kubectl** is tool to interact with cluster.
    - Create pods or other k8 components.

<img src="kubeCTL.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

1. **Api Server** is main entry point to the **K8 cluster**.
2. To talk to **Api Server** is trough different client. **KUBECTL** is most powerful of three clients.
3. Once **kubectl** submits command to the server. **Worker processes** will make things happen.
    - Create pods ... etc.

<img src="kubectlCanbeUsed.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

1. **Kubectl** can be used to interact with **Minikube cluster** or with **Cloud cluster**.
    - This can be interact with any type of **cluster** type.

- There is many ways to start **minikube**.
    - Container.
    - Virtual Machine.

<img src="runningMiniKube.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

- Instructions for starting. [Minikube start](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Fwindows%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2F.exe+download).

<img src="miniKubeCanBeRanWith.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

1. If **minikube** will be ran as **Container**. 
    - You need **driver** installed as following, example. **Docker**.

2. If **minikube** will be ran as **Virtual Machine**. 
    - You need **driver** installed as following, example. **VirtualBox**.

- **Docker** is recommended driver to be used with any situation.

<img src="2Layers.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

1. **minikube** comes with docker runtime and also driver for **minikube** where its hosted itself.

- There will be layers of **docker**.

<img src="2LayersSecond.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

- Starting **minikube** with driver. `minikube start --driver docker`.

- Asking status. `minikube status`.

- `kubectl` get installed as dependency when install **minikube**.

<img src="kubectlCommand.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

1. We can get status of the nodes in the cluster. `kubectl get node`.

<img src="differentTools.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

# Complete Demo Project: Deploy WebApp with MongoDB.

<img src="kubernetesDeployment.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

1. In cluster we will have **Webapp** and **Mongodb**.
    - Which will get configurations form **Secret** and **ConfigMap**.

<img src="creatingConfigurations.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

1. We will crate 4 **K8** configurations.
    - For **ConfigMap**.
    - For **Secret**.
    - Configurations for **MongoDB**.
    - Configuration for **WebApp**.

- We can use **kubernetes** documentation. Example for config map format.

<img src="formatOfConfigMap.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

- Example of **ConfigMap**.

<img src="configMapConfiguration.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

- Example of **ConfigMap**.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mongo-config
data:
  mongo-url: mongo-service # This will be Service name of the MongoDB. This will be endpoint of MongoDB.
```

<img src="secretConfiguration.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

- You can encode text using **git bash**  `echo -n mongopassword | base64`.
    - These can be used for kubernetes **secret**.

- Example of **Secret**.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mongo-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  mongo-user: bW9uZ291c2Vy
  mongo-password: bW9uZ29wYXNzd29yZA== 

```

<img src="referenceSecretAndConfigMap.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

1. We can reference these ones from different **deployments**.

<img src="mongoDeployment.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

1. `template` is **Configuration** for the **Pod**.
2. `containers` you can have multiple containers within the **pod**.
3. These usually are images form docker hub.

- We will be using latest at the time `8.0` [Latest to the docker hub.](https://hub.docker.com/layers/library/mongo/8.0/images/sha256-25c45597712d8f37915a52a172ce927ab197bcb764e81364df4c492083a20154?context=explore)

<img src="labels.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

1. In **K8** you can label any component with the **label**.
    - Adds additional label for identification.

<img src="labels2.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

1. When you have multiple **replicas** from same **pod**. Every **Pod** has unique name.
2. These can share common **label**.
    - You can tell that these are shared form same **pod**.

- **Important**. Every pod needs **label**!!

<img src="labelSelector.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

- We use **Selectors** for identifying **pod replicas** for specific **deployment**.

- Pods with `nginx` label which matches to the deployments label `nginx`, are grouped together.

- Standard for naming labels is using `app` for given label.  
    - Example. `app: nginx`.

-  `replicas: 1` how many replicas we want from this deployment.
    - For database we don't want use **deployment**, we want **stateful set**.

<img src="serviceConfiguration.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

1. Service needs to forwards the request to specific pod.

<img src="serviceConfiguration2.jpg" alt="alt text" width="700">

<img src="portsOfService.JPG" alt="alt text" width="700">

1. Port of where the request is coming into.
    - **Port of the service**.
2. Which port request is forwarded into, port of the **pod**. `targetPort` should be `containerPort`.
    - **Which port request is forwarded into in the pods**

- Example of **Deployment configuration**.

```
#  Deployment  & Service in one file.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mongo-deployment
  labels: # label for  deployment is optional, but recommended.
    app: mongo
spec:
  replicas: 1 # how many pods using this blueprint.
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongo # Standard is using app, and the label name.
  template:
    metadata:
      labels: # For pods this is required.
        app: mongo 
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mongodb
        image: mongo:8.0 # We are using 5.0 image version.
        ports:
        - containerPort: 27017
``` 

- Example of **Service configuration**.

```
# Service Configuration.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mongo-service # This is name of the service, which is used to access mongo.
spec:
  selector: # Points to the Pod where this service belongs to.
    app: mongo # The label of the pod.
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 9376 # Port of service. Standard these should be same.
      targetPort: 9376 # Port where to forward into. Standard these should be same.
```

<img src="passingCredits.PNG" alt="alt text" width="700">

1. We need to pass **Secret** and **CofigMap** the pods.

<img src="refSercret.PNG" alt="alt text" width="700">

1. We are referring **Secret** like such.

- We refer to **ConfigMap** with similiar way. 

```
   - name: DB_URL
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: mongo-config
              key: mongo-url
```

- We can use **NodePort** for making app accessible from external call.

<img src="usingNode.PNG" alt="alt text" width="400">

1. **NodePorts** are the port which will be opened to the **K8** **Nodes**.

- [NodePort documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport).

<img src="getPod.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

- We have **minicube** cluster running, but there is now component running. 
- Getting pod `kubectl get pod`
    - Before this one need **ConfigMap** and **Secret** must be existing before Deployments.

- We need components before **referencing** those components. 

<img src="creatingComponent.PNG" alt="alt text" width="600"/>

- Deploying to the **k8** with `apply` takes **k8** file as input. 
    - Following commands:

```
kubectl apply -f mongo-config.yaml
kubectl apply -f mongo-secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f mongo.yaml
kubectl apply -f webapp.yaml
```

- My `webapp.yaml` and docker hub image [DockerHub Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nanajanashia/k8s-demo-app).

```

```

<img src="referingToConfigMapOrSecretBenefit.PNG" alt="alt text" width="400">

- We only need to refer one **Secret** from many **Deployments**.

# Interacting with Kubernetes Cluster.

- All the components created form the **cluster**. `kubectl get all`
    - Example below.
